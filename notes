get argo pass - kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d

start:
minikube start 
minikube tunnel

What is Working:
- Jenkins on aws ec2
- full CI pipeline; build, text, publish, tag
- full CD; push to dev (after changing tags with auto incrementing system), push to main (**Required Approval**)
- full working minikube with aws connection, pulling from ecr with ImagePullSecret, argocd, and tunnel (Loadbalancing for external IP)
- argocd with 2 apps that connect to the git repo, 1 for dev, 1 for prod 
- full helm chart with dynamic nginx-configmap, nginx-deploy, nginx-svc, php-deploy, php-svc, and default values for dev, custom values for prod


ToDo:
- clean pipeline V
- namespaceing for dev and prod V
- fix jenkins and ec2 instance V - restart pc + restart ec2 fix the stabilty

Known Bugs / Bad practices:
- changing nginx conf in docker image only works on pipeline, must be changed in helm chart configmap 
- no tls/ssl on argocd and nginx
- webhook is currently disabled on github-jenkins ,infinty loop on push , scm skip NOT WORKING.
- no webhook on github-argocd, https is requirde to make it work.
- no dns names on apps, url with ip address
- docker images not cleaned after docker compose down on pipeline
- no IAM rules on jenkins ec2
- nginx refusing to serv index.php tried with index index.php on the /var/www/html where the index.php exist. fastcgi_index also didnt work.

Need to Check:
- aws ec2 ssh gives an error after a few second of connection "client_loop; send disconnect; Broken pipe"

things that took time to figure:
- synchronize between ecr to minikube
- pipeline infinty loop - NOT fixed
- pipeline approval check
- dynamic helm chart for both prod and dev without files collision
